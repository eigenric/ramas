			<h2>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</h2>
			<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>
			<p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>
			<p>Simple is better than complex.</p>
			<p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>
			<p>Flat is better than nested.</p>
			<p>Sparse is better than dense.</p>
			<p>Readability counts.</p>
			<p>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</p>
			<p>Although practicality beats purity.</p>
			<p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>
			<p>Unless explicitly silenced.</p>
			<p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
			<p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p>
			<p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</p>
			<p>Now is better than never.</p>
			<p>Although never is often better than *right* now.</p>
			<p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</p>
			<p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>
			<p>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>
